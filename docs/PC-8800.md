Adding the next 2 files :

Menus (Quasi88 only) and Japanese games will display the Japanese kanji characters. [Quasi88, lr-quasi88]

Not adding the next 2 files :

Menus will be in English (Quasi88 only) and Japanese games will **not** display the Japanese kanji characters. [Quasi88, lr-quasi88]

## Emulator: [Quasi88](https://www.eonet.ne.jp/~showtime/quasi88/)

Note that the emulator (and most documentation) is written in Japanese.

This emulator (if available) can be installed from the experimental menu of the [RetroPie-Setup script.](Updating-RetroPie#using-the-retropie-setup-script)

This emulator has better keyboard support. 

Recommended for :

- Working in "BASIC", "DOS" or "CP-M"
- Editing disks or files

## BIOS [Quasi88]

Place your BIOS files in:
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/BIOS/pc88
```

## ROMS [Quasi88]

Accepted File Extensions: **.d88 (disk) .88d (disk) .cmt (tape) .t88 (tape)** 

Place your PC-88 ROMs in:
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/pc88
```

## Controls [Quasi88]

By default, Quasi88 uses the keyboard for controls.  To enable a controller:

```
Press "F12".  This will bring up a menu with several tabs at the top.
Click the "mouse" tab.
Click the dropdown that's labelled "nomouse". Change it to "joystick".
```

Once this is done, the controls will be automatically mapped as such:
```
Left Joystick - Number Pad
A Button - "Z key"
B button - "X key"
```

To quit the emulator:
```
Press 3 times "F12". 
```

## Emulator: [lr-quasi88](https://github.com/libretro/quasi88-libretro)

This emulator can be installed from the experimental menu of the [RetroPie-Setup script.](Updating-RetroPie#using-the-retropie-setup-script)

This emulator has better joystick support. 

Recommended for :

- Games


## BIOS [lr-quasi88]

Place your BIOS files in:
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/BIOS/quasi88
```

## ROMS [lr-quasi88]

Accepted File Extensions: **.d88 (disk) .88d (disk) .cmt (tape) .t88 (tape) .m3u (playlist)** 

Place your PC-88 ROMs in:
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/pc88
```

## Controls [lr-quasi88]
lr-quasi88 utilises Retroarch configurations.

Add custom retroarch controls to the retroarch.cfg file in
```shell
/opt/retropie/configs/pc88/retroarch.cfg
```
For more information on custom RetroArch controls see: [RetroArch Configuration](RetroArch-Configuration)


## Insert disks in RetroArch menu (2 disk example) [lr-quasi88]:
(you can also use the joystick in the RetroArch menu, if configured)
```
Start the emulator with the first disk
Press "F1"
Press "Z-key"
Select, with "X-key", "Subsystems"
Select, with "X-key", "Load 2-Disk Game"
Select, with "X-key", the first disk file
Select, with "X-key", "Subsystems"
Select, with "X-key", "Load 2-Disk Game"
Select, with "X-key", the second disk file
Select, with "X-key", "Subsystems"
Select, with "X-key", "Start 2-Disk Game"
```

## Multiple disks (M3U playlist) [lr-quasi88]:
You can create an M3U playlist to easily start the core with multiple disks preloaded instead of using the subsystem interface. Create a text file with the extension ".m3u" and write the filename of each disk on a new line like in the example below.
```
# Ys II (Falcom)
Ys II (Program disk).d88
Ys II (Disk A).d88
Ys II (Disk B).d88
Ys II (User disk).d88
```

## Cycling between disks [lr-quasi88]:
If you've loaded multiple disks, you can hold one of the shoulder buttons and use the D-Pad(Arrow-keys) to change the disk that's loaded in each drive. 
Use L1-shoulder(Q-key) for Drive 1 and R1-shoulder(W-key) for Drive 2. 
When the shoulder button is released, the chosen disk will be inserted.

## Settings for games [lr-quasi88]:
[Fire Hawk] and many other games only work if the sub_cpu_mode is always using both CPUs.
We always kept this setting on, seems that emulation will always benefit.
Earlier binary emulator versions didn't have this core option.
So if it doesn't exist in the core options, you have to install the emulator from source.
You can set this from the RetroArch menu :
- Press "F1"
- Goto "Options"
- Goto "Sub-CPU Mode"
- Select "Always run both CPUs"
- Press "F1" 
- Press "ESC" (your setting are stored)

You can also set the q88_sub_cpu_mode in /opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch-core-options.cfg :
```
q88_sub_cpu_mode = "2"
```

[Final Crisis] and many other games require a different CPU clock.
Final Crisis works best on "8 Mhz".
You can set this from the RetroArch menu :
- Press "F1"
- Goto "Options"
- Goto "CPU"
- Select "8 Mhz....."
- Press "F1" 
- Press "ESC" (your setting are stored)

You can also set the q88_cpu_clock in /opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch-core-options.cfg :
```
q88_cpu_clock = "8"
```
